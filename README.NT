   For license information, please see license.txt included in this
   distribution.

*BEFORE* BUILDING, TESTING AND INSTALLING this you will need to:

    Build, test and install Perl 5 (at least 5.6.0 is recommended).
    It is very important to test it and install it!

    Build, test and install the DBI module (at least DBI 1.51 is
    required) if it is not already included in your perl distribution.

    No SQL Anywhere software needs to be installed to build this
    module; however, a SQL Anywhere client installation is required in
    order to use the module.

    A full SQLAnywhere client+server installation is recommended for
    testing this module otherwise the tests will be skipped.

Building:
    On UNIX:
	[ Linux, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, etc. ]

	source sa_config.sh (or sa_config.csh) from the SQL Anywhere
	installation

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	copy demo.db from the SQL Anywhere installation directory
	    to the current directory
	make test
	make install
    
    On Win32:
	[ requires Microsoft C and ActiveState's ActivePerl
	  (www.activestate.com) ]

	NOTE: ActivePerl 5.6.0 build 616 or later is required.

	perl Makefile.PL
	nmake
	copy demo.db from the SQL Anywhere installation directory
	    to the current directory
	nmake test
	nmake install

    Do not hand-edit the generated Makefile as those changes will be
    lost the next time 'perl Makefile.PL' is invoked. Always try to
    make changes via the Makefile.PL command line and/or editing
    Makefile.PL.

Notes:

For information on how to use DBD::SQLAnywhere, please invoke the
following after DBD::SQLAnywhere has been installed:

    perldoc DBD::SQLAnywhere

Prior to installation, you may instead run the following when
SQLAnywhere.pm is in your current directory:

    perldoc SQLAnywhere.pm

Examples can be found in the 'eg' directory:
    connect.pl  -> Demonstrates a simple connect.
    retrieve.pl -> Demonstrates retrieving data from a table and displaying the result set.
    blobs.pl    -> Demonstrates the use of blobs

For further examples, consult the test scripts located in the 't'
